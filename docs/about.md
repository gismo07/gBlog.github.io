Hi, I'm Johann, a PhD student working on autonomous driving, and this is my blog about my findings in the fields of **deep learning** and **robotics**.

## Publications
 - [Deep learning for lateral vehicle control – an end-to-end trained multi-fusion steering model](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-658-26435-2_17) - 10th International Munich Chassis Symposium 2020
 - [Development of lane-precise “Ground Truth” maps for the objective Quality Assessment of automated driving functions](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337008475_Development_of_lane-precise_Ground_Truth_maps_for_the_objective_Quality_Assessment_of_automated_driving_functions) - VDI Reifen Fahrwerk Fahrbahn 2019

## Open Source projects
 - [**COROS**](https://github.com/gismo07/coros) - containerized ros development environment with GUI in your browser
 - [**image_h264_encoder**](https://github.com/gismo07/image_h264_encoder) - ROS package for hardware accelerated encoding of images to h264 mp4
 - [**webviz-docker**](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/johannhaselberger/webviz) - web-based application for playback and visualization of ROS bag files
